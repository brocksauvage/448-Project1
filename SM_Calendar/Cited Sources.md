We used the QT IDE to create our project, this helped us implement a GUI. QT Design allowed us to
drag and drop a layout but that didn't do all of the coding for us. While QT was responsible for 
.ui file generation, .pro file generation (to execute the main program), and basic constructor
set-up, all of the implementation within the methods was our own. The structure,function, and 
visual design of the overall calendar was divided between teammates.

This was our IDE: https://www.qt.io/
